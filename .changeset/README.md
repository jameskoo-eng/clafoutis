# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in [our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Then follow the prompts to describe your change.

## Versioning

When changes are merged to main, the release bot will create a "Version Packages" PR that:
- Bumps the package version
- Updates the CHANGELOG.md
- Prepares for npm publishing

## Publishing

Once the "Version Packages" PR is merged, the release bot will automatically publish to npm.
